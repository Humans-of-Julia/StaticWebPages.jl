        A situation when a network flow is attacked can be modeled by a game between two players: an attacker who wants to remove a set of links that minimizes the flow value and a defender that wants to maximize the flow value.

        External data compression is a compression technique where the explicit data is stored as an external source such as hard-disks, streams, or any combination of distributed devices. The local device stores, in memory or cache, a small amount of explicit data that are the most likely to be used in the future. It also stores information required to stream (by small chunks) the rest of the data from the external source. This last process is called reconstruction.
